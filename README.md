# üìö Kindle Book Recommender System

## üìò Overview
This project implements a **Kindle Book Recommender System** that provides personalized book suggestions to users based on their reading preferences and past ratings.

The system uses:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand user demographics, book trends, and rating patterns  
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends books similar to those a user has liked, based on book metadata  
- **Collaborative Filtering (Item-Based):** Recommends books based on **book-to-book similarity**, using ratings from users with similar preferences  

_This hybrid approach allows for accurate and personalized recommendations for Kindle users._
